# jd

A jumper script for jumping to specific folders in a set of Johnny Decimal folders. 

## Installation

After building with `jpm build`, copy `jj.bat` and `jd-jump.exe` on to your path. [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is also expected on the path for this to work well.

## Example of usage

```
C:\Users\yumai\JD\20-29 Art>jj 40.01

C:\Users\yumai\JD\40-49 Programming\40 Projects\40.01 anno>jj 20-29

C:\Users\yumai\JD\20-29 Art>
```

## Status

This isn't intended to be more than a small utlity script.
